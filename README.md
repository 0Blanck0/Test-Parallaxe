# Parallax Effect Tester

## Introduction

This is a simple website created for testing the parallax effect. The parallax effect is a technique where background images move slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth and immersion as users scroll down the page.

## Technologies

* JavaScript: Used to implement the parallax effect functionality.
* CSS: Stylesheets are used for defining the appearance and layout of the website.
* HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web pages.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/parallax-effect-tester.git```

Then, open the index.html file in your web browser to view the website.

## Usage

Once the website is loaded, move mouse to observe the parallax effect in action.   
The background images should move at a different speed compared to the foreground content, creating a visually appealing effect.   
This is a test so isn't perfect.
